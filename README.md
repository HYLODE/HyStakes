# HyStakes

## Installation

### Mac OS (First run)

- Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- Install the [VSCode extension](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html) for Quarto
- Clone the repo at the command line

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HYLODE/HyStakes.git
cd hystakes
make dev_mac_os_first_run
direnv allow
```

### Development work

- Open VSCode in the hystakes directory
- You may(?) need to specify the Python kernel. This should be the one from the *hystakes* conda environment.
- Navigate to the example files and confirm that they render correctly by following the [Quarto instructions for VSCode](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html)
